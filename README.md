# Running HiBench Benchmark Suite on a single-node Hadoop Cluster

This repository is a technical documentation which was prepared as a warm-up session for my master's thesis work about benchmarking managed Hadoop systems.  

It was relatively easy to find sources on implementing Hadoop in virtual environment, but especially as a newbie on benchmarking concepts, it was not as easy to make it up running benchmark on it.  

So, if there are people out there who wanna play around with HiBench on a virtual Hadoop environment, I hope the instructions here would help them in making their first steps.  

I cannot guarantee any assistance if you get stuck in any of the steps, but I tried my best to give a detailed documentation as possible.  

Cheers and happy benchmarking!
