# Running HiBench Benchmark Suite on a single-node Hadoop Cluster

This repository is a technical documentation which was prepared as a warm-up session for my master's thesis work about benchmarking managed Hadoop systems by leveraging HiBench, which is a benchmarking tool.  

It was relatively easy to find sources on implementing Hadoop in a virtual environment, but especially as a newbie on benchmarking concepts, it was not as easy to make it up for benchmarking.  

So, if there are people out there who wanna play around with HiBench on a virtual Hadoop environment, I hope the instructions here would help them in making their first steps.  

I cannot guarantee any assistance if you get stuck in any of the steps, but I tried my best to give every taken step.  

Due to some reasons, I cannot publish all content of the study until the right time comes, sorry for that. (But soon)

Cheers, and happy benchmarking!
